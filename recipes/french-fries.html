    <h3 class="h3">Crispy, Seasoned French Fries</h3>
    <p class="p">Salty, tasty, and just the right amount of crisp! These fries are super 
        easy to make right at home.</p>
    
    <h3 class="h3">Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon onion salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="h3">Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl
            of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li><br>
        <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F
            (175 degrees C).</li><br>
        <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, 
            paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough 
            water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from 
            a spoon.</li><br>
        <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time and 
            place in hot oil to prevent them from clumping together. Fry 
            until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes
            ; drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
    </ol>
