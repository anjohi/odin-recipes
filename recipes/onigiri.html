    <h3>Rice Balls, the perfect side dish</h3>
    <p>Rice shaped in triangles or balls filled with your favorite ingredients. Common 
        fillings are pickled plums or salmon but just about anything salty will work and 
        plain is also very tasty. A yummy alternative to the American sandwich and a staple 
        for any bento (Japanese boxed lunch). Store in the refrigerator.</p>
